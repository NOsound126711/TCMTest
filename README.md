# TCMTest

To use these tests you need to fill in the username.csv, password.csv, and verification.csv with the appropriate information.
 
 Also it is better to allow the tests to run without any interference as
 this will affect the timing of the tests.

Once the test are done running, text files containing the failing results will be printed in the directory holding the test.

Use the following command to aggregate the text files:

cat *.txt >> results.txt
